         "Nul is a Classical Cepheid star, a yellow supergiant that pulsates (swelling 10-15% in size and luminosity) approximately every few months. Due to the variable nature of the star, attempts to terraform have not been successful, so the system was simply abandoned. To the public (and most law enforcement) there is nothing of interest in the system.  To a sliver of the criminal element, it’s the site of a slave market, set up for randomly determined times and locations to keep it under the radar.",
         "This guide can not, in good conscious, advise pilots to engage in human trafficking. Even with a less human set of morals, it would be ill-advised: modern slavers are just as likely to take a hapless cargo pilot right alongside his victims. The only advice is: avoid at all costs.",
